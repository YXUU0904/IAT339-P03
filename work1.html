          <p>In this project, we are working with SFU’s Sustainability Office to help the university and broader community understand sustainability research at SFU.</p>
          <p>These are the materials provided by the SFU’s Sustainability Office contain a lot of information, including definitions of terms, research topics, and statistics about the number of paper in different categories. The arrangement of this information is lack of legibility and hierarchy, for a general audience, it is difficult for him/her to fully understand all of these in a short period of time. Thus, if we want to present the information in the form of a static 1920x1080px design for digital display and make the information understandable by a general audience, it is important to make a decision about which pieces of information will be included.</p>

       <div class="work-paragraph">
       <p>In the brainstorming process, I was thinking to include all three types of sustainability which are ecological, economic, and social sustainability, and broadly introduce the definitions of them along with some statistics to allow the general audience to have an overview about what the sustainability is. Thus, I made several low-fidelity sketches centered around this idea.</p>

   <div class="work-paragraph">
   <p>Among the sketches above, I chose one of them that both figures and text accommodate in one page and there is enough space in the text area that I was able to put more information on it. in the lower left corner, I put  a figure of the earth surrounded by a few icons. The earth symbolizes the main target of sustainability. Each icon corresponds to the SDG(Sustainability Development Goal) introduced in the text area. Then, in the text area, I created three bar-graphs that compared the number of research paper which wrote by SFU professors or associate professors. </p>
