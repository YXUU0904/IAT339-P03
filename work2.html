          <p>In this project, we are working with SFU’s Sustainability Office to help the university and broader community understand sustainability research at SFU.</p>
          <p>These are the materials provided by the SFU’s Sustainability Office contain a lot of information, including definitions of terms, research topics, and statistics about the number of paper in different categories. The arrangement of this information is lack of legibility and hierarchy, for a general audience, it is difficult for him/her to fully understand all of these in a short period of time. Thus, if we want to present the information in the form of a static 1920x1080px design for digital display and make the information understandable by a general audience, it is important to make a decision about which pieces of information will be included.</p>

       <div class="work-paragraph">
       <p>In the brainstorming process, I was thinking to include all three types of sustainability which are ecological, economic, and social sustainability, and broadly introduce the definitions of them along with some statistics to allow the general audience to have an overview about what the sustainability is. Thus, I made several low-fidelity sketches centered around this idea.</p>

     <h2>First Draft</h2>
 </div>
 <div class="work-paragraph">
   <p>Among the sketches above, I chose one of them that both figures and text accommodate in one page and there is enough space in the text area that I was able to put more information on it. in the lower left corner, I put  a figure of the earth surrounded by a few icons. The earth symbolizes the main target of sustainability. Each icon corresponds to the SDG(Sustainability Development Goal) introduced in the text area. Then, in the text area, I created three bar-graphs that compared the number of research paper which wrote by SFU professors or associate professors. </p>

  <h2>Final Version</h2>
</div>

<div class="work-paragraph">
<p>After taking with my instructor, I got a few suggestions about the problems existed in my first draft. The bar graphs have no any meaning because it is not meaningful to compare the numbers of paper. In additions, the audiences might have no idea what each SDG means in details. Thus, in the final version, I focused on one specific aspect – the ecological sustainability, and provided more explanation to the SDG. Besides, I changed the bar graph to the form of block, which could show which aspect that SFU professors focus more on.  In the color scheme, I keep the icons and graphs in the same blue scheme to keep the consistency. </p>
