          <h1>Branding Identity Design</h1>
          <p>Summer 2017</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-paragraph">
          <p>This is an individual project in a graphic design course, which asked us to develop an identity for a given company, and I designed a logo particularly for a restaurant serving food for the cats. The first thing I did was visual brain dumping, which was a process combining brainstorming and sketching. I sketched as many symbols as I could about the connection between food and cats on paper. </p>

         <h2>Refinement</h2>
       </div>

       <div class="work-paragraph">
       <p>The second step was to select one sketch that communicated the proper feeling and emotion. I chose this one and then refined it with more details. Then, I started to transfer the sketch into digital form using Adobe Illustrator. I used pen tool to draw the initial shape of my logo, and then applied convert anchor point tool to drag the line for making the wavy shape.</p>

     <h2>Typeface</h2>
 </div>
 <div class="work-paragraph">
   <p> In this project, I realized the importance of typeface working as an element that communicated the message, and I also learned kerning that made the typography more balanced among different fonts. The “Wawa-SC” font we put on the logotype was like children’s handwriting, which represented a sense of relax, comfort, and ease to the audiences. The “Myriad” font we use on the business card and the letterhead looked more official and I kept the sans-serif style. </p>

  <h2>Final Version</h2>
</div>

<div class="work-paragraph">
<p>These were the final version of the logo and the set of brand identity design. I refined the logo and added more details to it. A cat’s face was focal point of the logo in order to show the company’s target customers. The fork and spoon which represented the idea of restaurant were placed in the arms’ position and outside of the circle. The fish was one of food that cats like. I combined these elements to communicate the company’s mission and value to the audiences.</p>

 <h2>Reflection</h2>
</div>

<div class="work-paragraph">
<p>The biggest problem I had met was unfamiliar with the design application, because I had no experience in using such computer software. For solving the problem, I watched many tutorial videos and spent long hours practicing the skill in order to make the lines smooth. With practice, the final logo met the objectives and clearly communicated the brand identity. The knowledge of Illustrator was great help to my future study. </p>
